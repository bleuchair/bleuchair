### Hi there, I'm Alan üëã

I'm a Software Developer who is passionate about making code more accessible, creating technology to elevate people, and building community. I have a strong affinity for creating tech that improves people's lives and I'm driven by turning ideas into reality through the power of software.

üî≠ I previously worked on [InspoBoard](https://www.getinspoboard.com/), a platform dedicated to bringing inspiration to every aspect of your life through personalized content and community-driven insights. I'm currently immersed in contributing my skills to a groundbreaking, yet-to-be-revealed startup that promises to redefine how we use technology in our daily routines.
